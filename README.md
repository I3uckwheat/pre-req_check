# Pre-requisite Check

Allows user to enter course. If a course has pre-req, it will be indicated. Also displays whether course entered is a pre-req for future course.

Current issues:

* Returns nothing if course entered doesn't exist.
* Returns generic message if course does not have pre-requisite.
* Does not address **and** or **or** or **co-requisite** situations.
